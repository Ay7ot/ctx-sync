Dividers:
	∙	Same color as borders but even more subtle
	∙	Used sparingly to separate logical sections
Shadows & Depth
Elevation System:
	∙	Subtle shadows throughout - not heavy drop shadows
	∙	Cards/panels: box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)
	∙	Hovered elements: Slightly stronger shadow with blue tint 0 4px 12px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.15)
	∙	Overlays: Stronger, more diffused 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)
Glow Effects:
	∙	Accent elements (like the blue GET badge) have subtle glow: box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.3)
	∙	Interactive elements get subtle color glow on hover
Spacing & Layout
Padding System (8px base unit):

	∙	Between sections: 16-20px
	∙	Between major components: 24-32px
Layout Principles:
	∙	Generous white space (well, black space) - never cramped
	∙	Consistent padding within similar component types
	∙	Optical alignment - elements aligned with intention, not just mathematically
Interactive Elements
Buttons & Pills:
	∙	Method badges (GET, POST, etc.):
	∙	Small, pill-shaped with generous horizontal padding (12-16px)
	∙	Uppercase text (10-11px, bold/semi-bold)
	∙	Background is the accent color at full opacity
	∙	Subtle glow effect matching the color
	∙	Border radius: 4-5px (quite rounded, almost fully pill-shaped)
Hover States:
	∙	Background: Lighten by 5-10% or add white overlay at 5% opacity
	∙	Border: Increase brightness or add accent color tint
	∙	Transition: Smooth, 150-200ms ease-in-out
	∙	Cursor: Always pointer for interactive elements
Focus States:
	∙	Accent color border (2px) or outline
	∙	Subtle glow matching accent color
	∙	Never remove focus indicators
Cards & Containers
Panel Style:
	∙	Background: Slightly lighter than main background
	∙	Border: 1px solid subtle gray
	∙	Border radius: 6-8px

Nested Cards:
	∙	Can have blue accent border (1-2px) for emphasis

	∙	Color: Matches text color of context (white or gray)
	∙	Hover: Accent color transition
Decorative Elements:

	∙	Square or slightly rounded (border-radius: 3px)
	∙	Background: Dark gray (#3a3a3a)
	∙	White text, 11-12px
	∙	Compact padding: 3-4px
Input Fields:

Overall Aesthetic Principles
Mood:
	∙	Professional yet playful
	∙	Modern, tech-forward
	∙	Dark but not oppressive
	∙	High contrast for readability
	∙	Colorful accents prevent monotony
Contrast Strategy:
	∙	White text on dark backgrounds for readability
	∙	Colored accents pop dramatically
	∙	Subtle grays for hierarchy without harshness
Visual Rhythm:
	∙	Consistent use of rounded corners creates softness
	∙	Pill-shaped badges create visual flow
	∙	Decorative icons break up technical density
Whitespace Philosophy:
	∙	Never crowded - elements breathe
	∙	Padding is generous but not wasteful
	∙	Grouping through proximity, not just lines
This is a modern dark-themed developer tool aesthetic with playful touches - think “serious tool that doesn’t take itself too seriously.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
